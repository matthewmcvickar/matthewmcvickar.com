          <h2>About</h2>

          <div>
            <p>I am a frontend web developer living in Portland, Oregon.</p>

            <p>I was born April 14, 1985 (I am currently <span
            id="currentAge">&hellip;</span>) and grew up on Cape Cod, Massachusetts with
            my parents and brother.</p>

            <img src="/img/matthewmcvickar-large.jpg" title="Me, Matthew McVickar"
            alt="photograph of a person in a blue checkered shirt and glasses smiling in
            front of a blurry background of a green bush">

            <p>I studied Japanese Language and Literature at the University of
            Massachusetts Amherst and Kansai Gaidai University in Japan.</p>

            <p>In 2007 I moved to Hawaii and co-founded a web development consultancy
            called Sakuzaku. From 2009 to 2014 I worked at <a
            href="https://ocupop.com">Ocupop</a> as a developer and art director. From
            2014 to 2020, I freelanced. I am now a senior developer at <a
            href="https://postlight.com">Postlight</a>.</p>

            <p>I am obsessed with music, and I spend a ton amount of time listening to
            and learning about it. I write about music on <a
            href="http://matthewmcvickar.tumblr.com" rel="me">my Tumblr</a> from time to
            time. Every year, I round up <a
            href="http://matthewmcvickar.tumblr.com/post/136274146527/2015-sounds">my
            favorite sounds</a>.</p>

            <p>I make ambient/electronic music and occasionally play live under my own
            name. You can hear <a
            href="https://soundcloud.com/matthewmcvickar/sets/original-music">samples of
            my music on SoundCloud</a>.</p>

            <p>From 2009 to 2013 I played in Clones of the Queen, an electronic pop band
            in Honolulu. We released <a
            href="https://clonesofthequeen.bandcamp.com">three great, free EPs</a> and
            played a ton of shows, including opening for The Cure.</p>

            <p>I have also recorded and released four EPs of solo electronic music as <a
            href="http://welwing.com/">Welwing</a>, and produced the music for the <a
            href="https://vimeo.com/29814962">Hawaii International Film Festival 2011
            trailer video</a>.</p>

            <p>I love bicycling, my dog Birdie, reading, and fall.</p>
