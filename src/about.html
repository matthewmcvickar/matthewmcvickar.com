    <h2>About</h2>

    <div>
      <p>I am a web developer living in Portland, Oregon.</p>

      <p>I was born April 14, 1985 (I am now 29) and grew up on Cape Cod, Massachusetts with my parents and brother.</p>

      <p>I studied Japanese Language and Literature at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and KansaiÂ Gaidai University in Japan.</p>

      <p>In 2007 I moved to Hawaii and founded a web development consultancy called Sakuzaku. From 2009 to 2014 I worked at <a href="http://ocupop.com/">Ocupop</a> as a developer and art director. In 2014 I began freelancing and I still am.</p>

      <p>I am obsessed with music, and I spend an inordinate amount of time listening to and learning about it. I write about music on <a href="http://matthewmcvickar.tumblr.com/" rel="me">my Tumblr</a> from time to time. Every year, I round up <a href="http://matthewmcvickar.tumblr.com/post/71795945660/2013-sounds">my favorite sounds</a>.</p>

      <p>From 2009 to 2013 I played in Clones of the Queen, a Honolulu electronic pop band. We released <a href="https://clonesofthequeen.bandcamp.com/">three great, free EPs</a> and played a ton of shows.</p>

      <p>I have recorded and released four EPs of solo electronic music as <a href="http://welwing.bandcamp.com/">Welwing</a>, and produced the music for the <a href="https://vimeo.com/29814962">Hawaii International Film Festival 2011 trailer video</a>.</p>

      <p>I love bicycling, standup comedy, walking, my dog Birdie, and autumn.</p>
