      <h3><a href="#metafilter">MetaFilter</a></h3>
      <p>After more than a decade with the same design, the venerable MetaFilter needed an update. Using prototypes started in 2008 as a starting point, I created a fully responsive design that leaves the core MetaFilter experience intact, makes the site more inviting to new users, and makes future maintenance easier.</p>

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I designed the mobile site myself&mdash;the original comps were for desktop only. I was able to extrapolate the design language into a mobile version that users have raved about.</li>
        <li>The mobile design uses hardware-accelerated CSS animations; it&rsquo;s fast, and feels like a native app.</li>
        <li>Bandwidth and speed are a top priorityâ€”the site uses an inline SVG sprite for almost all of its images, scripts and CSS are minified and concatenated, and requests are kept to a minimum.</li>
      </ul>
