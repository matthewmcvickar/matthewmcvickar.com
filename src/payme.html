    Other Options
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>PayPal, Stripe, and others services charge processing fees. The existence of Square Cash, Venmo, and checks makes this unnecessary, so I prefer not to use these services. If you are restricted in your payment method, <a href="mailto:matthew@matthewmcvickar.com">get in touch</a> and we can work it out.</p>
